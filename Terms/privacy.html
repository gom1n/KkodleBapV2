    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the 꼬들밥 app (hereby referred to as "Application") 
      for mobile devices that was created by MINCHAE KO (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") 
      as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
      <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
      <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
      <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.
      However, the Application collects your device's approximate location, which helps the Service Provider in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Geolocation Services:</strong> To provide personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized location data helps improve performance and functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Anonymized location data may be transmitted to external services to enhance offerings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time 
      to provide important information, required notices and marketing promotions.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
    <p>
      Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider 
      in improving the Application and their service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Application uses third-party services with their own Privacy Policies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or legal process;</li>
      <li>When disclosure is necessary to protect rights, safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>
      <li>With trusted service providers who work on their behalf under strict privacy rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the Application using the standard uninstall process 
      on your device or app marketplace.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>

      and for a reasonable time thereafter. To request deletion of your data, contact
